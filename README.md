## Collected examples from iOS 7 Programming Cookbook by Vandad Nahavandipoor

Spending some time to work through the examples in [iOS 7 Programming Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/iOS-Programming-Cookbook-Vandad-Nahavandipoor-ebook/dp/B00FW79LHE/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1401044211&sr=1-1&keywords=ios+7+programming+cookbook). These files should help designers pull up clean examples of iOS interface elements that would otherwise have to be drawn in a graphics program. Also, the files should provide clean code examples.
